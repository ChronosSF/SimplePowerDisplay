# cPointDisplay

## What is it?

A fan update of the abandoned [nibPointDisplay](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info17750-nibPointDisplay.html) by Nibelheim.

The addon provides a highly customizable graphical display of class points and aura stacks.

## Textures

cPointDisplay supports SharedMedia for textures. The default package contains Triangle, Circle, Plain, Soul Shard and Holy Power textures.

## Supported Power Types

- Combo Points
- Holy Power
- Soul Shards*

***Note***: For Soul Shards both full and fractional values are supported. Enable only one of them. The `Soul Shards Precise` units will work properly for Demonology and Affliction.
