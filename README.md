## Installation

To install just get the package from GitHub and extract it to your `<wow-installation-directory>\Interface\AddOns\` folder. You may need to rename the extracted folder to `cPointDisplay`.

If you have been using `nibPointDisplay` and want to keep your settings you should rename the file `<wow-installation-directory>\WTF\Account\<acc name>\SavedVariables\nibPointDisplay.lua` to `<wow-installation-directory>\WTF\Account\<acc name>\SavedVariables\cPointDisplay.lua`.
Then open the renamed file and change the string `nibPointDisplayDB` to `cPointDisplayDB`.
