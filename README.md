##Installation

To install just get the package from GitHub and extract it to your `<wow-installation-directory>\Interface\AddOns\` folder. You may need to rename the folder to `SimplePowerDisplay`.

If you have been using `nibPointDisplay` and want to keep your settings you should rename the file `WTF/Account/<acc name>/SavedVariables/nibPointDisplay.lua` to `WTF/Account/<acc name>/SavedVariables/SimplePowerDisplay.lua`.
Then open the renamed file and change the string `nibPointDisplayDB` to `SimplePowerDisplayDB`.
